# Check the features, the glossary and the specs

Runs the mechanical checks over every feature, not only the current spec's, and turns what they
find into questions. Before `/speckit-clarify`, these are its first questions: a contradiction or an
undefined word is exactly the ambiguity clarification exists to remove.

## User input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

Consider the user input before proceeding, if it is not empty.

## Run the checker

Read `.specify/extensions/bdd/bdd-config.yml` (where it is missing: `glossary: GLOSSARY.md`,
`features: features`, `specs: specs`, no `specs-from`, and as the `checker`
`uvx --from "git+https://github.com/thinkmorestupidless/speckit-bdd@v0.0.0#subdirectory=checker" speckit-bdd`),
then from the project root:

```bash
<checker> check --root . --glossary <glossary> --features <features> --specs <specs> --format json
```

When the config has `specs-from`, add `--specs-from <specs-from>`: the specs before it were written
before the project had features, and the checker does not read them. Leave those specs as they are.

It exits 0 with no findings and 1 with some; each finding has `file`, `line`, `check` and
`message`, and `specs` says how many specs were `checked` and how many older ones were `skipped`.
With `specs-from` set and `checked` at 0 while the current spec exists, the setting names a spec
later than the current one: say so and stop, rather than reporting the project clean. An exit of 2,
or a command that cannot be run, is a problem with the setup: say so and stop, rather than reporting
the project clean.

## Turn findings into questions

| Finding | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| `contradiction` | Ask which outcome is right, quoting both scenarios. Never choose one yourself. |
| `undefined-term` | Ask what the word means here, and whether it is the domain's (a term) or ordinary (an everyday word). |
| `refused-synonym` | Reword the step with the glossary's term; no question. |
| `repeated-scenario` | Remove the later copy and update any spec that names it; no question. |
| `unknown-scenario`, `removed-scenario-present` | Correct the spec's reference, or ask whether the scenario should exist. |
| `untraced-requirement` | Ask for the scenario that shows the requirement holds, or whether it is a requirement at all. |
| `duplicated-scenario` | Move the Given/When/Then into a feature and reference it from the spec; no question. |
| `parse` | Fix the Gherkin. |

Then read the features yourself for two things the checker cannot decide, and report each as a
suspicion, not a finding:

- **Implementation in a step**: a screen, a button, a route, a status code or a component, where the
  domain's words belong.
- **The same situation in other words**: two scenarios that differ in wording but describe the same
  preconditions and action. If their outcomes differ, it is a contradiction.

Also settle every `*Proposed.*` glossary term: ask whether the word is right, what it does not mean,
and which synonyms to refuse.

## Report

The questions, most consequential first (contradictions, then undefined terms, then the rest), each
with its file and line, followed by what was fixed without asking. Say how many specs were checked,
and how many older ones were not read.
